This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Machine Learning Project Work
#Author Ratan Jha
#First set directory to downloaded folder
# Source of this data is "http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har"
#http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#sbia_paper_section
# Download and save the file in a working directory
setwd("~/RforRatan/practicalmachinelearning")
# read training data
maindata <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
#set seed fro repeatable results
set.seed(32343)
#load caret library
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(e1071)
#Let Us turnoff warning messages for knitting to avoid seeing those messages
options(warn=-1)
# Upon inspecting the data, we find that first 5 columns which contains
# Since the number of predictors are huge (150) in the file,
# There is no way to plot and assess which variables are related more closely
# The other challenge since the output is a factor, it will not be right to do a 
# a correlation analysis to remove variables which are strongly correlated with each 
# other as well as weak relationship with the output variable
# use name, time stamp, window fields which is not a predictor variable
# first let us remove the first 5 fields
sourcedata <- maindata [,6:160]
# further investigation shows that data has blanks, NA and "#Div/o!"
# Let us remove these values with "NA"
sourcedata[sourcedata == ""] <- "NA"
sourcedata[sourcedata == "#DIV/0!"]  <- "NA"
# Only keep columns that have less than 40% NA in the columns
sourcedata <-
  sourcedata[, colSums(is.na(sourcedata)) < nrow(sourcedata) * 0.40]
#sourcedata <- sapply(sourcedata,as.numeric)
sourcedata$classe <- maindata$classe
write.csv(sourcedata,"InterimResults.csv")
#Split the training data into training and test set (75 to 25 ratio - since the sample size is large)
inTrain <-
  createDataPartition(sourcedata$classe,p = 0.75,list = FALSE)
training <- sourcedata[inTrain,]
testing <- sourcedata[-inTrain,]
# Set the class as a factor for analysis
training$classe <- as.factor(as.character(training$classe))
testing$classe <- as.factor(as.character(testing$classe))
# used randomForest function instead of train function as it happened to be many times faster
RFModel <- randomForest(classe ~ .,data = training)
#Check Class Error and Estimate of Error Rate
print(RFModel)
# Based on the model estimate of error on the test data will be 0.24%
# That would translate accurace of 99.76% ( A very high accuracy)
RFR <- predict(RFModel,testing)
RFC <- confusionMatrix(RFR,testing$classe)$overall[1]
# Check Accuracy for out 
print(RFC)
#random forest provided 99.6% accurate model while rpart gave only 49.8%. (removed code for rpart)
#Hence we would leverage random forest for predicting
#Read test Data
testdata <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
newtestdata <- training
#Only keep columns that are present in trainign data
newtestdata <- testdata[,names(testdata) %in% names(training)]
#since test data doesn't have classe column defined, we will add the columne
newtestdata$classe <- training$classe[1:1]
levels(newtestdata) <- levels(training)
#This code is to ensure that new_window has 2 factor variable as the training data has two values
levels(newtestdata$new_window) <- c("yes","no")
RPartFinalResult <- predict(RFModel,newtestdata)
#getoutput in just problem_id and Classes
answers <- data.frame()
# get problem_id from testdata & results from RPartFinalResult
answers <- subset(testdata,select = (problem_id))
answers$classes <- RPartFinalResult
print(answers)
# End of Programming
```

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
